		<h1 class="text-light">Health through Nutrition and Exercise</h1>
		<p class="text-light">
			A proper balanced diet of both food and liquids is very important, exercise in moderation is
			also very important for our health. 
			<br><br>
			WHY INLINE SPEED SKATING!? We have chosen to promote
			inline skating as our choice of exercise since it uses all our muscles and is of the highest
			in calorie burn and of the lowest in bodily impact (besides, it is fun). We also hike, bike,
			walk and swim but we feel inline skating is the best. 
			<br><br>
			WHY NON GMO AND ORGANIC!? What we
			consume is so critical. A simple way to remember what is good for us is if it is “Natural” or
			“Organic” We have to also watch where the Natural and Organic are coming from, some countries
			are not regulated or inspected and they are placing natural and organic labels just to meet
			the consumer demands. Countries outside of the USA are using raw sewage to fertilize with and
			is considered organic, just imagine all the diseases carried in raw sewage. Some countries are
			also using Shrimp and Tilapia to resolve their sewage problems and then selling it to the USA.
			<br><br>
			"ORGANIC IS SO EXPENSIVE!" ..On the contrary Organic may seem more expensive to purchase but
			it can actually be more affordable. For one, you get more nutritional value out of it than non
			organic foods, and also staying healthier, staying away from the pesticides, and sewage slugde
			they put on the plants. More product ability, less down days and smaller to no doctor bills.
			We should aim to live healthy lives, our future selves will thank us for it, less chemical
			consumption, less poisons for our bodies, healthier us. 
			<br><br>
			POISONOUS MEATS IN YOUR FRIDGE! Meats
			that are not fed their proper diets are actually poison to our bodies. Ranchers that are more
			interested in faster growth for higher and faster yields feed their animals and birds
			antibotics, steroids and growth hormones which are not consumables for humans. Animals and
			birds that do not get a proper diet and exercise are also unhealthy and if they are unhealthy,
			they are also unhealthy to consume. We shouldn't speed the growth process of the animals; we
			need to just let them mature and give them the time they need to grow, in open fields. For the
			companies that are all about the money, the more they can jam into an area and the faster they
			grow, the sooner they can go on the market. 
			<br><br>
			BLEACHED SUGARS! PRESERVATIVES! SLOWLY DECAYING
			YOUR BODY! We have found that the biggest killers outside of all chemicals and pharmaceutical
			drugs are bleached sugar, all artificial sweeteners, artificial foods, diet, processed foods
			and preservatives, the list goes on but that is the main ones.
